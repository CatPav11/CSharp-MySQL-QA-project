# CSharp-MySQL-QA-project
Final Project

Why are we doing this?

The project is an opportunity to show what we have learned in C# and MySQL during the academy. It is also a chance to consolidate our learning by working independently without the immediate support of an instructor and to solve problems on our own.

How did I expect the challenge to go?

I had enjoyed using C# during the academy so was looking forward to working on the project. I expected that I would encounter some problems but that I would be able to solve them independently with some thought

What went well

I found that I was able to recall and use MySQL very well, even though we had not used it for some weeks during the academy. I also found it reasonably straightforward to use C# to link up with MySQL 

What didn’t go as planned?	

As the laptop I had used throughout the academy broke down on the first day of the project, I lost all of my previous C# and My SQL code that we had worked on so no longer had them for reference which was an additional challenge. I also couldn’t get on the MySQL system until late on the first day due to password access which delayed me from creating my database. 
I also had trouble with returning the count of records from my SQL to C# as I don’t recall doing this in the academy and probably spent too long on problem solving this. 

Possible improvements for future
For the future I would like to make the code smaller and more streamlined. Some of my functions are a bit clunky so with some practice I would like to improve on those.
